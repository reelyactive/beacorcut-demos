Demos of the beaver-cormorant-cuttlefish stack
==============================================

[beaver](https://github.com/reelyactive/beaver) handles a _stream_ of radio decoding events which provide the real-time location of people and assets in a physical space. 

[cormorant](https://github.com/reelyactive/cormorant) dives into the resulting _pond_ of device identifiers, collecting any associated metadata from [chickadee](https://github.com/reelyactive/chickadee) and the web.

[cuttlefish](https://github.com/reelyactive/cuttlefish) renders and displays this metadata in a visual, human-friendly way, in a web browser.
